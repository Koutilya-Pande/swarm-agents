# Swarm Agents

Welcome to the **Swarm Agents** repository! This project showcases AI agents built using OpenAIâ€™s Swarm framework, designed to automate various tasks collaboratively by assigning specialized roles to different agents.

## Overview

**OpenAI Swarm** is a framework that enables multiple AI agents to work together in a coordinated manner. Each agent is assigned a specific responsibility, allowing complex workflows to be broken down into manageable tasks that agents can handle independently. By combining the strengths of various agents, Swarm facilitates efficient task completion through collaboration and communication.

This repository contains a collection of AI agents built using the Swarm framework, each specializing in different stages of automated content creation and other tasks that benefit from distributed AI capabilities.

Each agent is configured to work within the Swarm framework, which enables seamless communication and task handoffs between stages. This approach enhances productivity and ensures that the final output is accurate, engaging, and optimized.
